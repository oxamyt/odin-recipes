        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These are sweet little cheese pancakes usually served with jam, sauce, or syrup. As a traditional food you can find them in plenty of restaurants, although they always seem to taste better when grandma makes them.</p>
        <h3>Syrnyky Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>600 grams Cheese</li>
            <li>2 large Eggs</li>
            <li>120 grams (1 cup) Flour</li>
            <li>3 tbsp Sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp Salt</li>
            <li>Sunflower Oil for frying</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Blackberry Sauce Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>250 grams Fresh Blackberries</li>
            <li>3 tbsp Sugar</li>
            <li>2 tbsp Water</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps to make Syrnyky</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Just add all the ingredients to a bowl and start mixing. If you find it is quite wet, add more flour a tbsp at a time.</li>
            <li>Mold the syrnyky dough into thick disks like hockey pucks.</li>
            <li>In a pan add just enough oil to coat the bottom, and then add another glug for good measure. Let the oil get hot and carefully lay down the syrnyky. Fry in batches. Cook each side until golden brown (about 1-2 minutes). Remove from the pan and place them on a paper towel lined plate. This is kind like like if you were making frittersâ€¦since in a way these are sweet cheese fritters.</li>
        </ol>
            <h3>Steps to make sauce</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>In a pan on medium heat add the blackberries and the sugar. Give the pan a shake and then add the water. Stir the pan every so often and to assist the blackberries breaking down.</li>
        <li>After about five minutes your pan should look like the picture above. If your berries have not burst open due to the heat go ahead and break them with a fork or spoon. This syrup can be served chunky like a sauce, or you can strain it out for a thinner version.</li>
        </ol>
